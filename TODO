>> TODO 29118 <<
core:
	- Easier rendering
	- Object list <SCRAPPED>
	- Easier to change transform
	- Don't pass in new instances of things like model texture in constructer
	- Easier to get shader
	- Make it possible to script scenes
	- Connect the physics engine with the normal engine.
	- Remove all the hard-coded stuff
	- Better rendering (more efficient)
	- Custom model files
	- Configuration file for models
shaders:
	- More shaders
	- Specular lighting
	- Better diffuse
	- Customizable shader values
physics:
	- Add axis-aligned bounding boxes
	- Add rotatable bounding boxes
	- Add deflection for physics objects
math:
	- Add more math functions (dot, cross, etc)
